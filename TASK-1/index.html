                In Basic Part of E-learning of ZIPPY it has some info to know. It has very low amounts of interactivity (i.e., clicking the Next button
                 is as interactive as it typically gets) and there is a lot of static text and images. Level 1 quizzes are usually basic multiple-choice and 
                 true-or-false questions. Level 1 e-learning, while basic, does have its place: it can be a quick and inexpensive way to cover simple rules or procedures.

                In Intermediate Part of E-learning of ZIPPY it has some info to know. Courses at this level can contain some audio and video, as well as some basic animations
                 and transitions. This level of content is also often accompanied by narration and activities such as “click and reveal” interactions. Typical level 2 
                 quizzes are drag-and-drops and matching activities. Level 2 e-learning is often used because it’s a nice middle ground that offers a richer experience
                  for the learner without too much development expense (comparatively) for the designer.

                In Expert Part of E-learning of ZIPPY it has some info to know, the courses become quite sophisticated, creating a more complex and interactive learning experience. Level 3 can include 
                extensive use of audio, video, transitions, animations, simulations, and more. Quizzing could involve branched, scenario-based questions that allow a 
                learner to explore multiple paths and feedback levels. Level 3 e-learning is often developed for more advanced training, such as flight simulation or 
                medical training.

            <h2>Get certified in different technologies <i class="fas fa-user-graduate" id="icon"></i></h2>
            <p>Many IT positions deal with specific technical procedures or software, so becoming certified in a specialized area proves to employers that you have the precise skills needed to succeed in that role.

                Earning an IT certification is a great way to build up and showcase your tech skills on a resume as you work to break into the field. They help provide an at-a-glance validation of your technical proficiency to hiring managers and recruiters and can prove useful as you aim to advance within your career.
                
                So which certifications and credentials should you consider pursuing if you’re looking to kick-start your IT career? To help you get a better idea of where to begin, we used real-time job analysis software to identify several excellent IT certifications and credentials that are commonly sought after in positions requiring limited (0-2 years) experience.</p>
            <br>
            <p>ZIPPY is a massive open online course (MOOC) provider with university-level courses developed by schools, nonprofit organizations and corporations. These programs are offered for free to users, with courses from universities such as MIT and Harvard. Courses include short videos, interactive learning exercises, tutorial videos, online textbooks and a forum where students can interact with one another, ask questions and reach out to teaching assistants. At the end of your course, you’ll received a certificate — and some courses might count as college or university credits, depending on the school.</p>
            <br>
            <p>ZIPPY offers courses and nanodegree certifications in programming and development, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, business, data science and autonomous systems. While the certifications aren’t free, a lot of the courses included in ZIPPY’s nanodegree programs are offered at no cost. You can choose from a long list of free courses in programming and computer science from universities and companies such as Stanford, Amazon and Google. If you decide to complete a nanodegree certification you will need to pay a monthly fee of $400; nanodegrees typically take users six to 12 months to complete. </p>
            <p>ZIPPY offers free coding classes in 12 programming and markup languages, including Python, Ruby, Java, JavaScript, jQuery, React.js, AngularJS, HTML, Sass and CSS. The courses promise to give hands-on experience and real-time feedback from peers. If you like the courses, you can sign up for a Codeacadmy Pro account for $19.99 per month, which will give you more access to hands-on projects, quizzes and advisors. Otherwise, the basic courses are all offered for free — so if you’re a self-motivated worker, they might be enough to get you skilled in coding. </p>

                    I was absolutely shocked to see that ZIPPY had such Positive reviews! I am 15, and I started using ZIPPY because I wanted to learn Java, 
                    (as a  Full Stack developer) and purchased 4 courses on the subject. The first one I started was the ultimate guide to Java. 
                    I am only about halfway into it,
                     and I am VERY pleased! the videos are very high quality, and the courses have a note-making system that I find extremely useful.

                  <h1>Most Recommended Feedbacks</h1>
                  <p>Many of my coworkers choose to use ZIPPY for continuing education. I feel it has the best selection, training and curriculum vs others 
                      I have tried. Yes, the courses may be longer than others, but they're more detailed.</p>
